Basically that was the first project to work on as a real javascript thing so Thanks so much for everything, Udacity! :D.

## I first had to do the nav bar which was the easiest part of it all which was looping through the sections and adding a <li><a></a></li> inside the ul everytime it iterates to a section 



## Then i made the navigating work through the href and then changed it as a matter of practice to using the method .scrollIntoView(); 




## making the nav respond to being in the viewport was a pain though i managed to thankfully do it :D.
